Redux:
    "Redux is a predictable state container for javascript apps"
        -redux is for javascript applications
            -redux is not tied to react.
            -it can be used with react,angular , vue or even vanilla javascript
            -redux is a library for javascript applications
        -redux is a state container
            -redux stores the state of your applications
            -redux will store and manage the application state
        -redux is predictable
            -Manage the state of your application in a predictable way,redux can help you.

React-Redux:
    -React-Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React
        React-------(React-Redux)-------Redux
Summary:-
    -raect is a library used to build user interfaces
    -redux is a library for managing state in a predictable way in javascript applications
    -react-redux is a library that provides bindings to use react and redux together in an application

Core Concepts in Redux:
    Action:-
        It describes the changes in the state of the application
            -Plain javascript objects
            -it containes the object of information
            -it must have type property that indicates the type of action being performed
            -the type property is typically defines string constant
            -the only way your application interact with the store
            -Carry some information from your app to the redux store
            -action tells the reducer what to do.
    Dispacher:-
        It takes the information or state and send to the reducer.it also called as postman
    Reducer:-
        Which actually carries out the state transition depending on the Action
            -it takes the current state and return new state, then send to the store
            -reducer tells the store, how to do.
            (previouseState, action) => newState
    Redux Store:-
        only one store for the entire application
            responsibilities:
                -it holds the state of your application
                -Allows access to state via getState()
                -Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
                -registers listners via subscribe(listner)
Principles:
    1)."the state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store"
        -all of your state stored in single object
            ex: {
                 numberOfCakes:10
                }
    2)."the only way to change the state is to an action, an object describing what happened"
        -To update the state of your app, you need to let redux know about that with an action 
        not allowed to directly update the state object
        ex: {
            type: BUY_CAKE
            }
    3)."To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers"
         Reducer-(previouseState, action) => newState
         ex:
            const reducer = (state, action) => {
                switch(action.type) {
                    case BUY_CAKE: return {
                        numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes - 1
                    }
                }
            }
                    subscribed
                         ----(javascript app)-----
                        |                          |dispatch
                        |                          |
                    (redux store)               (Action)
                        |                          |
                        |                          |
                         -------(reducer)----------

Middleware:
    -Is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality
    -Provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the momment it reaches the reducer
    -Use middleware for logging, crash reporting, performing asynchronous tasks etc
            -npm install redux-logger

Async action creators:
    axios:
        -request to an API end point
    redux-thunk:
        -standerd way to define async action creators
        -it is a middle ware
    For these ---we have to install two packeges
        -npm install axios redux-thunk
